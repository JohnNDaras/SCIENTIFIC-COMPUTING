Optimized Numerical Algorithms: Cholesky and LU Decomposition
<ul>
  <li><strong>1st part: Advanced Matrix Operations with Cholesky Decomposition in C</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In the first subpart, we solve linear systems using the Cholesky method, including decomposition, solving equations, and error analysis. The program reads input from a file and prints results.</li>
      <li>In the second subpart, we invert matrices using Cholesky decomposition, validating the result by multiplying with the original matrix to get the identity matrix. Error calculation and file input support are included.</li>
    </ul>

  <li><strong>2nd part: Advanced Matrix Operations with LU Decomposition in C</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In the first subpart, we implement LU decomposition in C for efficient solution of linear systems, including functions for decomposition, substitution, and inversion, with error handling for numerical stability.</li>
      <li>In the second subpart, we focus on leveraging LU decomposition for matrix inversion, providing functions for decomposition, inversion, and error calculation. Additional features support various matrix operations like multiplication, subtraction, and file input, making it versatile for numerical computations.</li>
